PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
 
NAME OF PROJECT: CAMPUS-CONNECT

WEBSITE LINK: https://campus-connectt.netlify.app/


INTRODUCTION:
The Campus Connect Web Application is a prototype that enables students in KNUST access information about profiles of other students who share similar fields of interest. The prototype aims to create a platform where students can connect, explore, and collaborate based on their academic and professional interests. This is a limited version of the full system and uses local storage for user authentication and storing user data.


AIM OF PROJECT:
The proposed project is a web application that enables students in KNUST to access information about profiles of other students who share similar fields of interest. The website aims to create a platform where students can connect, explore, and collaborate based on their academic and professional interests.


OBJECTIVES:
1. Provide a user-friendly web interface for students to create and manage their profiles.
2. Implement a matching algorithm to identify and display profiles of students with similar fields of interest.
3. Enable students to search and filter profiles based on specific criteria.
4. Implement robust security measures to protect user data and ensure
privacy.


FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY:
The proposed website will include the following features:
1. User Registration and Login: Students can create an account, provide their details, and log in to access the platform.
2. Profile Creation: Students can create and manage their profiles, including personal information, academic background, interests, skills, and experiences.
3. Search and Filters: Provide search functionality allowing students to search for profiles based on specific criteria i.e fields of interest.
4. Responsive Design: Ensure the website is optimized for different devices and screen sizes.


ARCHITECTURE:
The Campus Connect Web Application prototype follows a client-side architecture using Vue.js for the frontend and a local storage for handling user registration and profile data.


FRONTEND
1. The frontend of the prototype is built using Vue.js,aprogressive JavaScript framework.
2. Vue Router is used for client-side routing to navigate between different pages.

BACKEND AND DATABASE
1. The backend of the prototype is implemented using local storage to handle user registration and profile data.
2. For this prototype,local storage is used as a simple database to store user credentials, images, fields of interest and profile data on the client side.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
1. Vue.js: The frontend of the prototype i sbuilt using Vue.js,a progressive JavaScript framework.
2. Local storage
3. HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for designing the website.
4. Git: Version control system fo rcollaborative development.
5. Deployment Platform : NETLIFY

INSTALLATION AND SETUP
1. Clone the mini-project repository.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory.
3. Install the dependencies : npm install
4. Start the development server : npm run serve
5. The frontend will be running at http://localhost:8080.
OR
6. You can access the site directly from : https://campus-connectt.netlify.app/ .

USAGE GUIDE
1. Open you rweb browser and navigate to https://campus-connectt.netlify.app/ .
2. Register a new account with your fullname,email and password.
3. Login with your credentials.
4. Select your desired fields of interest.
5. Navigate your a homepage.
6. Edit your profile by providing relevant information about your personal, academic and contact details. Add work experiences if any.
7. Add or update your profile picture.
8. Search for other fields of interest.
9. View the profiles of users with similar interests as you.
10. Logout from your account.


LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
1. As this is a prototype, it uses local storage for user authentication and storing user data. In a production version, a proper database and server-side authentication should be used.
2. The search functionality in this prototype is limited to searching for other fields of interests. A more advanced matching algorithm can be implemented in the future to add search for other students.

CONCLUSION
The Campus Connect Web Application prototype demonstrates the core features and functionality of a platform where students can connect, explore, and collaborate based on their academic and professional interests. With the potential for further development and enhancements, Campus Connect could become a valuable tool for students on the KNUST campus to find like-minded peers and foster academic and professional growth.
